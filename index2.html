<p class="suiiiiii"> <br><b> you think why i did not add earth to that list i did not add it becous it is hear and more information becous it our home planet  </b></p>
<p class="suiiiiii"> <br><b> Our home planet is the third planet from the Sun, and the only place we know of so far thatâ€™s inhabited by living things. While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is the only world in our solar system with liquid water on the surface. Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of the four planets closest to the Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal.

Earth is the only planet in the Solar System whose English name does not come from Greek or Roman mythology. The name was taken from Old English and Germanic. It simply means "the ground." There are, of course, many names for our planet in the thousands of languages spoken by the people of the third planet from the Sun.  </b></p><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/mf8UbIDew7e8g" width="480" height="411" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/earth-mf8UbIDew7e8g"></a></p>
