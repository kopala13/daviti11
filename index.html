The Sun’s volume would need 1.3 million Earths to fill it. Its gravity holds the solar system together, keeping everything from the biggest planets to the smallest bits of debris in orbit around it. he hottest part of the Sun is its core, where temperatures is 15 million degrees Celsius.</b></p><img class="joebaiden" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRIPi0kJ3IN1eWznb23rtHvlfzn6C7pzVG2mg&usqp=CAU">
   <p class="suiiiiii"><br><b> mercury is smallest planet in our solar system From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as it does when viewed from Earth, and the sunlight would be as much as seven times brighter. Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system – that title belongs to nearby Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere. at night time on mercury is −173 °C but on day time +427 °C</b> </p><img class="joebaiden" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSofXMl22Tv0mxW5Cf7-7UltfULznXQBnFgOQ&usqp=CAU">
    <p class="suiiiiii"><br><b>Venus is the second planet from the Sun. Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide and it’s perpetually shrouded in thick, yellowish clouds of sulfuric acid that trap heat, causing a runaway greenhouse effect. It’s the hottest planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to the Sun. Surface temperatures on Venus are about 900 degrees Fahrenheit (475 degrees Celsius) – hot enough to melt lead. The surface is a rusty color and it’s peppered with intensely crunched mountains and thousands of large volcanoes. Scientists think it’s possible some volcanoes are still active. </b></p><img class="joebaiden" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcT6k0Ep5-8Kn-zMNdHBjpUBvP8w2K_qjMo_YA&usqp=CAU">

Mars is also a dynamic planet with seasons, polar ice caps, canyons, extinct volcanoes, and evidence that it was even more active in the past. Mars is one of the most explored bodies in our solar system, and it's the only planet where we've sent rovers to roam the alien landscape </b></p> <img class="joebaiden" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSGM8e6AYjpxPgyfrdsZQmhTCiyb5IS__5isA&usqp=CAU">
     <p class="suiiiiii"> <br><b>Jupiter has a long history of surprising scientists – all the way back to 1610 when Galileo Galilei found the first moons beyond Earth. That discovery changed the way we see the universe. Fifth in line from the Sun, Jupiter is, by far, the largest planet in the solar system – more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined.

Jupiter's familiar stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water, floating in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter’s iconic Great Red Spot is a giant storm bigger than Earth that has raged for hundreds of years. </b></p> <img class="joebaiden" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcScvnBa4NgoMxfjROFeAasYwXBbPatN9KhLnw&usqp=CAU">
<p class="suiiiiii"> <br><b> Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest planet in our solar system. Adorned with thousands of beautiful ringlets, Saturn is unique among the planets. It is not the only planet to have rings – made of chunks of ice and rock – but none are as spectacular or as complicated as Saturn's.
Like fellow gas giant Jupiter, Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium.  </b></p> <img class="joebaiden" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcS2FEXoikAV2u-D2gcXMu20VsGQRtUgT5i28Q&usqp=CAU">
<p class="suiiiiii"> <br><b>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun, and has the third-largest diameter in our solar system. It was the first planet found with the aid of a telescope, although he originally thought it was either a comet or a star. It was two years later that the object was universally accepted as a new planet, in part because of observations by astronomer Johann Elert Bode. Herschel tried unsuccessfully to name his discovery Georgium Sidus after King George III. Instead, the scientific community accepted Bode's suggestion to name it Uranus, the Greek god of the sky, as suggested by Bode.​</b></p>

<p class="suiiiiii"> <br><b>Neptune is the eighth planet from the Sun and the farthest known planet in the Solar System. It is the fourth-largest planet in the Solar System by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17 times the mass of Earth, and slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere. Being composed primarily of gases and liquids, it has no well-defined solid surface. The planet orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an average distance of 30.1 astronomical units (4.5 billion kilometres; 2.8 billion miles). It is named after the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical. </b></p>
